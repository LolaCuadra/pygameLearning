# Overview

I have been working on learning how to do the classic games for computer like mine sweeper, X and 0, and now the snake game

I had so much fun learning the logic behind the snake game and how to implement the pyGame to bring it to life. I tried many different functions and how to best used them. For being my favorite game the Snake Game logic throw me off a bit trying to understanding everything how to make it colide if it eat itself, or how when it colides with the apple it will increase the score, and other things

here is me testing the game for showcasing:

# Development Environment

In Visual Studio Code my Snake Game written in Python, is using the PyGame library to add music, create a new window where the snake game can come to life

# Future Work
* Change Background (maybe a picture instead of an rgb)
* Make it colide if it touches the screen borders
* Sound for when it dies you get to hear a scream or something
